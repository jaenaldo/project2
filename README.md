I've created interactive maps that illustrate county-level US Presidential election results spanning from 2000 to 2020 in 48 states, using Python and the Bokeh library. These maps visualize the voting percentages for the two major parties (Democratic and Republican) through a color mapping system. Counties with a higher Republican voting rate are portrayed in shades of red, while those leaning towards the Democratic party are depicted in various shades of blue. These maps reveal a predominantly uniform pattern at the state level, but they also capture significant changes at the county level, particularly in the mid-east and mid-west regions. I believe these maps serve as valuable tools for analyzing political trends across the states and for making predictions regarding the 2024 presidential election results. Below you'll find images of the interactive maps. To view the voting percentages, simply download the HTML files at the top and hover your mouse over the map. Thank you.
